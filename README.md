# Getting Started with Create React App

MERN stack application that allows the user to create, read, update, and delte data when realted to the users travels.

Why?

This project was buiult because planning travels and remembering travels often do not have their own space to exist and revisit. This applicaiton allows the user to log that information.

How I accomplished this app

Express and Mongo work together to build a schema and store the data. Routes are used to carry out CRUD functionality. I used a seed route to ensure the data was flowing correctly. React does the heavy lifting and maps the data from Mongo and displays them. HTML functions such as buttons allow the user to perfomr CRUD actions.
